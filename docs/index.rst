Welcome to pyMOE's documentation!
=================================

pyMOE is a Python library for designing and producing masks for Micro Optical Elements. 

Features
********

Mask design features: 

* Designing multi-layer (grayscale) masks from analytical and/or numerical (e.g. Gerchbergâ€“Saxton) methods  

* Designing single layer (binary) dithered masks from grayscale masks 

* Designing rudimentary metasurfaces masks 

* Numerical scalar propagation methods (Rayleigh-Sommerfeld, Fresnel, Fraunhofer) of electric fields from (grayscale) masks 

Mask production features: 

* Image file (binary/grayscale) <-> CAD files input-output conversion  

* Operations with/within mask files (e.g. change layer numbers, make intances, CAD file import, merge shapes, ...)  


Dependencies
************

A list of dependencies (with versions) is at https://github.com/INLnano/pyMOE/blob/main/requirements.txt . To use the package straighforwardly please make sure you have these dependencies (and versions) installed. 


Modular architecture 
*********************

pyMOE is based on a modular architecture, where each module provides specific functionalities. The use of each module and its inter-modular connections is exemplified at  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465524002546#fg0060 and practically in the example notebooks (there is one notebook for each module). 


Literature
