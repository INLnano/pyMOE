# pyMOE
Python library for designing and producing masks for Micro Optical Elements. 


# Features
Mask design features: 
* Designing multi-layer (grayscale) masks from analytical and/or numerical (e.g. Gerchbergâ€“Saxton) methods  
* Designing single layer (binary) dithered masks from grayscale masks 
* Designing rudimentary metasurfaces masks 
* Numerical propagation methods (Rayleigh-Sommerfeld, Fresnel, Fraunhofer) of electric fields from (grayscale) masks 

Mask production features: 
* Image file (binary/grayscale) <-> CAD files input-output conversion  
* Operations with/within mask files (e.g. change layer numbers, make intances, CAD file import, merge shapes, ...)
